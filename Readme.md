##Financial Analysis

This project aims to implement the analysis of Stock market Data. Initially we are considering data from NASDAQ. 

The problem statement is documented in the file FinancialAnalysisTasks.xlsx, and the completed queries are documented in the files .hql (hive query language) or .pig (pig script extension) in folders Hive and Pig respectively, they are updated as they are available. 

NASDAQ data is available in the Data folder, to remove the header from each file and to consolidate all the files, two scripts are provided in the Data floder which will create one file for daily_prices and one for diviends.

We intend to approach towards each problem statement either in Hive or Pig or both, so that we gain hands-on experience on both the Eco-system components.
